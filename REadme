#We have scheduled a meeting on 2nd of Aug at 12:00.

#Until the next meeting,we will try to figure out(find a solution) the topics 1,2 and 3.

#You have access to use Ã–cal`s github : https://github.com/Ocalak/Heart_disease_risk

#REadme <- Here I publish the useful links, books etc for the project 
#Test.R <- Share the code here.
#You can add new folder and change the things there. 





#Topics
#1) Data check for NA's
#2)Find out how to manipulate the data.
  #) Mutate the variables as factor and check the levels
     # check how can we use the some variables with more than 2 levels.
       # An example AgeCategory has 13 levels. How can we convert it ? 
         # I used ; 
           #   data2 <- data %>% mutate_if(is.character,as.factor)
           #   data2$AgeCategory <- unclass(data2$AgeCategory) ##'Try it to see'##
           # Question is did I do the right thing? Can I use it like that? if yes how? 

#3)Lets say we manipulated the data. Lets find out which predicters to use which to drop?
    # Check interactions of highly corr predicter
    #Check if we combine the predicters, Exp ; Diabetic * GenHeath 
    

#4)choose correct model
  # for that we have many options but we should try all the models to find which is best
   #Logistic Reg
   #KNN
   #Naive Bayes
   #Decision Tree
   #etc...


Here I publish the links textbooks or anything that might help us for the project.
Feel free to add the things.


Firt of all I was spying the Martin's github account. And I found many things there.
